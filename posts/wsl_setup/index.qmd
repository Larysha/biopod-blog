## Why WSL?

The Unix command line is the foundational tool for bioinformatics. It's where you access servers, wrangle large files, and automate analysis by chaining together customisable commands. Most bioinformatics software is built to run in this environment because it's simply the most efficient way to work with biological data at scale.

If you're on Linux or macOS, you're sorted—the terminal is already there. But Windows users have historically been stuck. PowerShell works fundamentally differently to Unix shells, leaving you with awkward workarounds: dual-booting, virtual machines, or third-party tools like Cygwin. None of these provide a smooth experience.

Enter the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), first released in 2016. WSL2 offers a proper Linux kernel running directly on Windows—no virtual machine overhead, full access to both file systems, and seamless integration. For bioinformatics, you'll want Ubuntu, a Debian distribution compatible with virtually all third-party tools.

## Installing WSL

**Requirements:** Windows 10 (build 19041+) or Windows 11

1. Open Command Prompt as administrator (`Win Key` → search "command prompt" → "run as administrator")
2. Type: `wsl.exe --install`
3. Restart your computer when prompted

That's it. Ubuntu installs by default.

When you first open Ubuntu:
- Create a username and password (doesn't need to match your Windows credentials)
- Remember this password—you'll need it for any `sudo` commands
- Note: you won't see characters when typing passwords in terminal. This is normal.

Update your system:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

Your WSL is now set up.

## Terminal Options

WSL runs from the Ubuntu terminal by default, which works perfectly fine. But if you want a more polished experience with multiple tabs and better aesthetics, consider:

**Windows Terminal** — Microsoft's modern terminal app, available from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701). Supports multiple tabs, custom themes, and sets WSL as the default profile easily.

**Fluent Terminal (recommended for the aethetics) ** — An alternative with similar features, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/felixse/FluentTerminal) or the [MS Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/fluent-terminal/9P2KRLMFXF9T). Open Menu → New Tab → WSL, then set it as default in Settings → Profiles.

Both let you run multiple shells (WSL, PowerShell, Command Prompt) in one window.

### Making It Pretty (Optional)

This won't affect functionality, but if you want your terminal to look good:

**Easy option:** Use the built-in themes in Windows Terminal (`Settings` → `Appearance`) or Fluent Terminal (`Settings` → `Themes`).

**Customisation:** Edit your `~/.bashrc` file to change your prompt colours and format. Modify the `PS1=` variable—[this guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/change-bash-prompt-linux) covers the details.

**Pre-built themes:** Install [oh-my-bash](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash) for ready-made themes. Note: installation creates a new `.bashrc` file. Your old one gets backed up as `.bashrc.omb-backup-[date]`. Copy any custom aliases or settings from the backup to the new file. Browse themes [here](https://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash/wiki/Themes) and set your choice by editing the `OSH_THEME` variable in `.bashrc`.

## Navigating Between Windows and Linux

Your WSL home directory lives at `/home/your_username/`, separate from your Windows files. To access Windows files from WSL, mount your C: drive:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/your_windows_username/
```

All Windows drives are accessible under `/mnt/`. External drives usually appear automatically as `/mnt/d/`, `/mnt/e/`, etc.

If an external drive doesn't mount automatically:
```bash
sudo fdisk -l  # list all partitions
sudo mount -t drvfs d: /mnt/d  # mount drive d:
```

**Shortcuts:** Create aliases in `~/.bashrc` to jump to frequently used directories:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
# Add at the end:
alias docs="cd /mnt/c/Users/your_name/Documents"
# Save, then: source ~/.bashrc
```

Now typing `docs` takes you straight there.

**Key points:**
- Access Windows from WSL: `/mnt/c/`
- The leading `/` is essential (represents root)
- Hidden files (starting with `.`) appear with `ls -a`

## Adding Programs to PATH

When you install third-party software in your home directory (`~/`), you'll want it accessible from any working directory. Add the executable's location to your `$PATH` variable:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
# Add at the end (replace paths with your software locations):
export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/home/bin/your/software:$PATH"
# Save and reload:
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify:
echo $PATH
which your_program  # shows where the executable is located
```

Once in `PATH`, your software works from anywhere—including Windows directories.

## Essential Tools

### Conda

[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/) provides Python package management and virtual environments:

```bash
cd ~
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda.sh
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
```

Restart your terminal. You should see `(base)` before your prompt, indicating the base conda environment is active. Learn conda basics [here](https://learning.anaconda.cloud/conda-basics).

**Alternative:** If you prefer `pip` and `venv`:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv ipython3
```

### Git

Git comes pre-installed with WSL2. Configure it:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"  # use your GitHub email
git config --global core.editor "nano"  # or "code" for VSCode
```

Check your settings: `git config --list`

### R and Devtools

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install r-base

# Optional but useful R dependencies:
sudo apt install \
  r-base-core \
  r-recommended \
  r-base-dev \
  build-essential \
  libcurl4-gnutls-dev \
  libxml2-dev \
  libssl-dev
```

Launch R by typing `R`, then install devtools:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
```
Exit R with `q()` and `n`.

### Docker

Docker containers eliminate dependency headaches by packaging everything an application needs to run. Many bioinformatics tools are available as Docker images.

1. Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)
2. During installation, enable WSL2 integration
3. Open Docker Desktop → Settings → General → ensure "Use the WSL 2 based engine" is enabled

Verify in terminal: `docker --version`

Note: Docker only works in WSL whilst Docker Desktop is running in Windows.

Full setup guide: [Docker WSL documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/)

### Nextflow

Nextflow creates scalable, reproducible bioinformatics pipelines. Setup is straightforward:

```bash
# Check Java version (needs v11+):
java --version

# If you need to install Java:
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
sdk install java 17.0.10-tem

# Install Nextflow:
wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash
chmod +x nextflow
sudo mv nextflow /usr/local/bin/  # makes it globally accessible
```

Explore community pipelines at [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/).

### VSCode Integration

Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on Windows, then add the [Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack).

From WSL, open any directory in VSCode:
```bash
code .
```

VSCode will connect to WSL automatically and you can edit files, run terminals, and debug directly through the WSL environment.

You now have a fully functional bioinformatics environment: Unix tools running natively on Windows, access to both file systems, and all the major software frameworks installed. Time to start analysing data.
