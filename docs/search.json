Modify the PS1= variable—this guide covers the details.\nPre-built themes: Install oh-my-bash for ready-made themes. Note: installation creates a new .bashrc file. Your old one gets backed up as .bashrc.omb-backup-[date]. Copy any custom aliases or settings from the backup to the new file.

My work involves teaching computers to understand how grapevines handle drought - specifically, which genetic variants matter enough to test in the lab rather than just existing in massive datasets. This blog is where I make sense of what I’m learning because I enjoy making technical work accessible without stripping out what makes it interesting. If you’re curious about computational biology, you might find something useful here.\nBesides my work, I’m interested in too many things for my own good, but the hobbies that I’ve stuck with include sketching, yoga and making sourdough.

    "text": "What Actually Is Quarto?\nQuarto is an open-source scientific publishing system. Think of it as Markdown Pro: write content in .qmd files (Quarto Markdown), and it renders to HTML, PDF, Word docs, presentations, or entire websites.\nHere’s why it matters for science communication:\nIt’s built for data science workflows. You can embed R or Python code directly in your documents, execute it during rendering, and include the outputs (plots, tables, analysis results) automatically. Write once, render everywhere.\nIt’s fast and portable. Static site generation means no database, no server-side processing, just HTML/CSS/JS files that load instantly. Host it on GitHub Pages for free.\nIt handles citations natively. BibTeX integration, cross-references, figure numbering—all the academic infrastructure without third-party plugins.\nIt scales from notebooks to books. Same syntax works for Jupyter-style notebooks, scientific papers, presentations, and full websites. Your lab report and your blog post use the same toolchain.\nThe perks aren’t just in ease of rendering, but also the custom aesthetics you want to add to your site. With Quarto, you can write SCSS that compiles directly to CSS. You control exactly what gets rendered. No mystery CSS from seventeen different plugins competing for specificity. No surprise JavaScript breaking your site after a theme update. Just your code, doing what you told it to.\nFinally, because academic work should be reproducible, your entire site is version-controlled plain text files in Quarto. You can see exactly what changed between versions, roll back mistakes, and rebuild the site identically on any machine with Quarto installed."

    "section": "The Technical Architecture",
    "text": "The Technical Architecture\nHere’s what happens when you build a Quarto site:\nYour content (.qmd files)\n         ↓\nQuarto processes Markdown + code chunks\n         ↓\nExecutes R/Python/Julia code (optional)\n         ↓\nApplies theme (SCSS → CSS)\n         ↓\nRenders to HTML\n         ↓\nStatic site in _site/ or docs/\nEverything from your .qmd source to the final HTML happens in a single render step. The output is pure static files—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images—that you can host anywhere.\n\nHow SCSS Extends CSS\nStandard CSS is great but repetitive. Want to use the same colour scheme across your site? You’re copying hex codes everywhere. Need to adjust all your heading sizes proportionally? Find-and-replace time.\nSCSS (Sassy CSS) adds programming features to CSS:\nVariables:\n// Define once\n$bg-primary: #e0cdc5;\n$text-heading: #323619;\n\n// Use everywhere\nbody {\n  background-color: $bg-primary;\n}\nh1 {\n  color: $text-heading;\n}\nNesting:\nInstead of writing separate CSS rules for related elements, SCSS lets you nest them hierarchically. This mirrors your HTML structure and makes relationships between elements clearer:\n.navbar {\n  background: $bg-primary;\n  \n  .nav-link {\n    color: $text-heading;\n    \n    &:hover {\n      color: darken($text-heading, 10%);\n    }\n  }\n}\nFunctions and mixins:\nMixins are reusable chunks of CSS that you can include wherever you need them, with optional parameters. They’re perfect for repeated patterns:\n@mixin rounded($radius) {\n  border-radius: $radius;\n  -webkit-border-radius: $radius;\n  -moz-border-radius: $radius;\n}\n\n.box {\n  @include rounded(10px);\n}\nWhen you run quarto render, it compiles your SCSS to standard CSS automatically. You write the human-readable SCSS with variables and logic, browsers get optimised CSS.\n\n\nQuarto’s Theme System\nQuarto uses Bootstrap 5 as its base framework, which means you get a solid foundation of responsive design, typography, and components out of the box. Your custom theme extends Bootstrap by overriding its default variables and adding your own rules.\nA Quarto SCSS theme has two sections:\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n// Variable overrides go here\n// These change Bootstrap's default values\n$body-bg: #e0cdc5;\n$body-color: #000000;\n$font-family-sans-serif: 'Crimson Text', serif;\n\n/*-- scss:rules --*/\n// Custom CSS rules go here\n// These add new styles or override specific elements\n.hero-container {\n  display: flex;\n  gap: 4rem;\n}\nThe defaults section runs first, setting up your design variables. Then Bootstrap compiles with your variables. Finally, the rules section applies your custom styles on top.\nThis means you’re not fighting Bootstrap—you’re configuring it, then adding your own layer where needed."

No “works on my machine” issues because you forgot to update a dependency.\nLess to remember. I can edit a post, commit, and push from my phone if needed. GitHub handles the build.\nBackup safety.
