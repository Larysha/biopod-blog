Modify the PS1= variable—this guide covers the details.\nPre-built themes: Install oh-my-bash for ready-made themes. Note: installation creates a new .bashrc file. Your old one gets backed up as .bashrc.omb-backup-[date]. Copy any custom aliases or settings from the backup to the new file.

My work involves teaching computers to understand how grapevines handle drought - specifically, which genetic variants matter enough to test in the lab rather than just existing in massive datasets. This blog is where I make sense of what I’m learning because I enjoy making technical work accessible without stripping out what makes it interesting. If you’re curious about computational biology, you might find something useful here.\nBesides my work, I’m interested in too many things for my own good, but the hobbies that I’ve stuck with include sketching, yoga and making sourdough.

    "text": "What Actually Is Quarto?\nQuarto is an open-source scientific publishing system. Think of it as Markdown Pro: write content in .qmd files (Quarto Markdown), and it renders to HTML, PDF, Word docs, presentations, or entire websites.\nHere’s why it matters for science communication:\nIt’s built for data science workflows. You can embed R or Python code directly in your documents, execute it during rendering, and include the outputs (plots, tables, analysis results) automatically. Write once, render everywhere.\nIt’s fast and portable. Static site generation means no database, no server-side processing, just HTML/CSS/JS files that load instantly. Host it on GitHub Pages for free.\nIt handles citations natively. BibTeX integration, cross-references, figure numbering—all the academic infrastructure without third-party plugins.\nIt scales from notebooks to books. Same syntax works for Jupyter-style notebooks, scientific papers, presentations, and full websites. Your lab report and your blog post use the same toolchain.\nThe perks aren’t just in ease of rendering, but also the custom aesthetics you want to add to your site. With Quarto, you can write SCSS that compiles directly to CSS. You control exactly what gets rendered. No mystery CSS from seventeen different plugins competing for specificity. No surprise JavaScript breaking your site after a theme update. Just your code, doing what you told it to.\nFinally, because academic work should be reproducible, your entire site is version-controlled plain text files in Quarto. You can see exactly what changed between versions, roll back mistakes, and rebuild the site identically on any machine with Quarto installed."

    "section": "The Technical Architecture",
    "text": "The Technical Architecture\nHere’s what happens when you build a Quarto site:\nYour content (.qmd files)\n         ↓\nQuarto processes Markdown + code chunks\n         ↓\nExecutes R/Python/Julia code (optional)\n         ↓\nApplies theme (SCSS → CSS)\n         ↓\nRenders to HTML\n         ↓\nStatic site in _site/ or docs/\nEverything from your .qmd source to the final HTML happens in a single render step. The output is pure static files—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images—that you can host anywhere.\n\nHow SCSS Extends CSS\nStandard CSS is great but repetitive. Want to use the same colour scheme across your site? You’re copying hex codes everywhere. Need to adjust all your heading sizes proportionally? Find-and-replace time.\nSCSS (Sassy CSS) adds programming features to CSS:\nVariables:\n// Define once\n$bg-primary: #e0cdc5;\n$text-heading: #323619;\n\n// Use everywhere\nbody {\n  background-color: $bg-primary;\n}\nh1 {\n  color: $text-heading;\n}\nNesting:\nInstead of writing separate CSS rules for related elements, SCSS lets you nest them hierarchically. This mirrors your HTML structure and makes relationships between elements clearer:\n.navbar {\n  background: $bg-primary;\n  \n  .nav-link {\n    color: $text-heading;\n    \n    &:hover {\n      color: darken($text-heading, 10%);\n    }\n  }\n}\nFunctions and mixins:\nMixins are reusable chunks of CSS that you can include wherever you need them, with optional parameters. They’re perfect for repeated patterns:\n@mixin rounded($radius) {\n  border-radius: $radius;\n  -webkit-border-radius: $radius;\n  -moz-border-radius: $radius;\n}\n\n.box {\n  @include rounded(10px);\n}\nWhen you run quarto render, it compiles your SCSS to standard CSS automatically. You write the human-readable SCSS with variables and logic, browsers get optimised CSS.\n\n\nQuarto’s Theme System\nQuarto uses Bootstrap 5 as its base framework, which means you get a solid foundation of responsive design, typography, and components out of the box. Your custom theme extends Bootstrap by overriding its default variables and adding your own rules.\nA Quarto SCSS theme has two sections:\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n// Variable overrides go here\n// These change Bootstrap's default values\n$body-bg: #e0cdc5;\n$body-color: #000000;\n$font-family-sans-serif: 'Crimson Text', serif;\n\n/*-- scss:rules --*/\n// Custom CSS rules go here\n// These add new styles or override specific elements\n.hero-container {\n  display: flex;\n  gap: 4rem;\n}\nThe defaults section runs first, setting up your design variables. Then Bootstrap compiles with your variables. Finally, the rules section applies your custom styles on top.\nThis means you’re not fighting Bootstrap—you’re configuring it, then adding your own layer where needed."

You only commit source files, not generated HTML. Your diffs show actual content changes, not thousands of lines of auto-generated code.\nConsistency. Every build happens in the same environment. No “works on my machine” issues because you forgot to update a dependency.\nLess to remember. I can edit a post, commit, and push from my phone if needed. GitHub handles the build.\nBackup safety. If my laptop dies, I can clone the repo on any machine and keep working. The entire site rebuilds from source.\n\nThe trade-off is slightly more complex initial setup (the workflow YAML file), but once it’s configured, it just works. I haven’t touched that file since I set it up."

    "text": "Where Does Deep Learning Fit?\nBefore diving into neural networks, it helps to see where deep learning sits in the broader machine learning ecosystem. It’s part of a continuum or “umbrella” of methods that biologists already use, not something completely separate (and which I have whimsically illustrated below).\n\n\n\nThe machine learning landscape\n\n\nLet’s do a quick tour:\nSupervised learning includes familiar territory - linear regression for modelling growth curves, logistic regression for disease prediction, decision trees for variant classification. These models learn from labelled data: you provide input-output pairs, and they learn the mapping.\nUnsupervised learning is for when you don’t have labels. This is where clustering comes in, such as identifying cell types from expression profiles, and dimensionality reduction, like visualising high-dimensional datasets with PCA or t-SNE. You’re looking for structure in the data itself.\nBayesian methods give you a probabilistic framework for incorporating prior knowledge. GWAS analyses often use Bayesian approaches when you want to integrate what’s already known about genetic associations with new evidence.\nEnsemble learning - random forests, boosting methods like XGBoost - combines multiple simpler models to get better predictions than any single model could achieve. These are workhorses in genomics, particularly for expression prediction and disease risk modelling.\nAnd then there’s deep learning - a subfield that excels at large, complex, high-dimensional data. It includes various architectures, but the ones most relevant for sequence data are convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and, more recently, transformers. You can also get creative and combine architectures into hybrid approaches, depending on the scale of the problem.\nThe point: deep learning isn’t replacing these other methods. It’s another tool, suited to specific kinds of problems where traditional approaches hit their limits."

    "text": "Why Deep Learning for Biology?\nLet’s use a concrete example: finding regulatory elements in DNA\nTraditionally, researchers have used motif scanning tools to predict where transcription factors bind based on experimental data. These methods work by searching DNA sequences for known patterns - short stretches of nucleotides that match previously experimentally identified binding sites in a closely related organism. While useful for generating large databases of motifs, they come with significant limitations: they can’t discover new regulatory sequences, and by design, they’re reductionist, treating motifs in isolation without much certainty about whether a motif is even functional in context.\nThis is where deep learning becomes powerful. Neural networks can learn local features like short motifs, but they can also capture higher-order patterns - motif spacing, combinations, orientation, and context. Crucially, they don’t require prior knowledge. They learn regulatory features directly from sequence data, discovering patterns that might not match any known motif but still drive gene expression.\nIt’s also become feasible. Hardware advances - particularly GPUs enabling parallel computing - mean you can train models with millions of parameters in hours instead of weeks. Software frameworks like Keras, PyTorch, and TensorFlow have made building and implementing these models much more accessible. You don’t need to code the algorithms from scratch anymore."

    "text": "The Building Block: What’s a Perceptron?\nBefore we can understand neural networks, we need to understand their basic unit: the perceptron.\nThe concept of an artificial neuron traces back to the 1940s, when neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and logician Walter Pitts proposed a simplified mathematical model loosely inspired by how neurons fire in the brain. Rosenblatt’s perceptron in 1958 refined this into something closer to what we use today.\nHere’s the idea: a perceptron is a computational unit that interprets signals from multiple inputs. Each input has a weight - a learned parameter that determines how much that input matters. The perceptron calculates a weighted sum of its inputs, adds a bias term, and then applies a threshold test. If the result exceeds the threshold, the perceptron “fires” and passes a signal forward. If not, it stays silent. The perceptron learns, through training, which weights to assign to each input.\nIf you want the full history and a clear walkthrough of how perceptrons actually work under the hood, this YouTube video is excellent. It covers the evolution of neural networks from their origins to modern implementations in a way that makes the concept click."

Instead of a single perceptron making a decision, you have multiple perceptrons working together, each learning to recognize different patterns in the data.\nLet’s look at the simplest version: a feed-forward neural network.\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a feed-forward neural network\n\n\nIn the diagram above:\nLayer 0 (input layer): Your feature vector - for example, a DNA sequence that has been numerically encoded in some way.\nLayer 1 (hidden layer): Where the processing happens. Each neuron receives signals from all input neurons, weights them according to “learned” parameters, and “decides” whether to pass the signal forward based on its threshold.\nLayer 2 (output layer): The prediction - perhaps a classification (predicted “high” or “low” expression of a gene, based on the DNA sequence and the “learned” target patterns) or a continuous value (predicted relative expression levels on a scale).\nDuring training, the network compares its predictions to the actual outcomes and adjusts the weights to minimize it’s mistakes or “error”. This happens iteratively, over thousands or millions of training examples, until the model converges on a set of parameters that work.\nThe key insight is that each layer builds on the previous one. The first layer might learn simple patterns (this sequence appears here), the next layer combines those into more complex patterns (these sequences appear together), and so on.

    "text": "K-means Clustering\nK-means is conceptually simple: you specify the number of clusters (\\(K\\)) you want, and the algorithm groups your data accordingly.\nHere’s how it works. The algorithm calculates the Euclidean distance \\(d\\) between data points. For two points \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) with coordinates \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\):\n\\[d(p, q) = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\]\nSamples with minimal distance between them are assigned to the same cluster. Each cluster has a “centroid” - the centre point of all samples in that cluster. As new points are added, the centroid is recalculated iteratively by computing the mean position of all points in the cluster.\n\nChoosing the Right K\nHow do you know how many clusters to use? One common approach is to calculate the sum of squared errors (SSE) for each cluster:\n\\[{SSE}_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_k} (x_i - C_k)^2\\]\nwhere \\(n_k\\) is the number of points in the cluster, \\(C_k\\) is the cluster centroid, and \\((x_i - C_k)^2\\) is the squared Euclidean distance between each point and the centroid.\nYou sum the individual cluster SSE values to get a total SSE (\\(SSE_T\\)), then repeat this for different values of \\(K\\). Plotting \\(SSE_T\\) against \\(K\\) gives you an “elbow plot” - the \\(SSE_T\\) typically decreases as \\(K\\) increases, but at some point the rate of decrease slows down. That inflection point, the “elbow”, suggests the optimal number of clusters.\n\n\n\nElbow plot showing total SSE for varying values of K. The optimal number of clusters is typically where the decrease plateaus - in this case, K = 3 or 4 would be appropriate.\n\n\nThe method is somewhat subjective and often requires domain expertise to interpret correctly. Is the elbow at \\(K\\) = 3 or 4? It depends on your biological question.\n\n\nExample: Gene Expression Under Stress\nHere’s a simple illustration. Suppose you’ve measured expression levels for many genes under drought stress and normal conditions in wheat. Each data point represents a gene, and the axes represent expression levels under the two conditions.\n\n\n\nScatter plots clustered with K=4 (left) and K=3 (right). Each point represents a gene; axes show expression under drought (y-axis) and normal conditions (x-axis). Different values of K may be appropriate depending on the biological question.\n\n\nWith \\(K\\) = 4, you differentiate between genes that are highly expressed under drought but show varying expression under normal conditions. With \\(K\\) = 3, those groups are collapsed. Neither is “wrong” - the choice depends on what you’re trying to understand.\nK-means has been effective for identifying clusters of co-expressed genes from microarray data, where each cluster might correspond to a specific phenotype like height ranges in wheat or cancer subtypes. The algorithm is straightforward and computationally efficient, but it’s sensitive to the initial placement of centroids and your choice of \\(K\\). Many implementations focus on improving the initialization step to achieve more stable convergence and better quality clusters.\nIf you don’t know the number of clusters in advance, or if you want to understand relationships between clusters, hierarchical clustering is a better option."

Manhattan distance - the sum of absolute differences between corresponding data points - can be more robust to large individual variations. Many specialized distance measures exist depending on the application, particularly for sequence data.\n\n\nLinkage Criteria\nLinkage determines how clusters merge:\n\nSingle linkage: Uses the shortest distance between any two points in different clusters. This tends to form chain-like structures.\nComplete linkage: Uses the largest distance between points in different clusters. This produces more compact clusters.\nAverage linkage: Averages distances between all pairs of points across clusters. This balances the extremes.\n\nYour choice of distance measure and linkage criterion directly affects the dendrogram structure and, ultimately, the biological interpretation of your clusters.\n\n\nApplications in Biology\nHierarchical clustering is widely used in gene expression studies, though it can lack robustness depending on the data. It also underpins many phylogenetic algorithms that infer evolutionary relationships from sequence data.\nPhylogenetic clustering often uses sequence-specific distance measures like alignment scores or substitution models. Common methods include UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean), Neighbour-Joining, Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian inference approaches. The choice of distance metric, alignment method, and model assumptions significantly influences the inferred evolutionary relationships."

    "text": "How PCA Works: A Visual Walkthrough\nWe’ll use two variables here for visualization, but the principles apply to datasets with thousands of dimensions. You just can’t draw them anymore - but the math still works.\n\nStep 1: Center the Data\nFirst, calculate the mean for each variable. This gives you the center of your data.\n\n\n\nFinding the center of the data by averaging each variable.\n\n\nThen shift the data so this center sits on the origin (0, 0). This normalizes your data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Note that shifting doesn’t change the relative position of points to each other - it just relocates the entire dataset.\n\n\n\nData shifted to center on the origin. This is normalization - mean of 0, standard deviation of 1.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Find the Line of Best Fit (PC1)\nNow we need to find the line that best describes the data. There are two equivalent ways to think about this:\n\nMinimize the distance from each data point to the line (the residuals)\nMaximize the distance from projected points on the line to the origin\n\nPCA uses the second approach because it’s computationally easier. But why are these equivalent?\n\n\n\nDemonstrating the equivalence of minimizing residuals and maximizing projected distances using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n\nConsider one data point, say sample 5. Draw a line from the origin to the sample point (distance \\(a\\)), from the sample point perpendicular to the fitted line (distance \\(b\\)), and from the projected point to the origin (distance \\(c\\)). You’ve formed a right-angled triangle.\nBy the Pythagorean theorem: \\(a^2 = b^2 + c^2\\)\nSince \\(a\\) is fixed (the distance from origin to the sample doesn’t change), maximizing \\(c\\) is the same as minimizing \\(b\\). PCA algorithms maximize \\(c\\) - the distances from projected points to the origin.\n\n\n\nThe sum of squared distances (SSD) from projected points to the origin. When SSD is maximized, we’ve found PC1.\n\n\nThis distance is squared for each point (to remove negative values), then summed. This is the Sum of Squared Distances (SSD). When the SSD is largest, you’ve found the line of best fit. This line is PC1 (Principal Component 1).\nThe average of the SSD (divided by \\(n-1\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of samples) is the eigenvalue for PC1 - a measure of how much variation PC1 captures. The square root of the eigenvalue is the eigenvector or singular value for PC1.\n\n\nStep 3: Interpreting PC1’s Composition\nIf PC1 has a slope of 0.25, it means that for every 4 units along the x-axis (gene 1), you go up 1 unit on the y-axis (gene 2). The data is mostly spread out along the gene 1 axis.\n\n\n\nPC1 with a slope of 0.25 means it’s composed of 4 parts gene 1 and 1 part gene 2.\n\n\nIn other words, PC1 is made up of 4 parts gene 1 and 1 part gene 2. This ratio shows that gene 1 is more important for describing the spread of the data. PC1 captures the linear combination of genes 1 and 2.\nWe can calculate the length of this vector using Pythagoras: \\(\\sqrt{4^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{17} = 4.12\\)\nIf you’re using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) - a common method for computing PCA - the vector is scaled so its length equals 1. Divide each component by the length: \\(4 \\div 4.12 = 0.97\\) and \\(1 \\div 4.12 = 0.24\\).\nThis gives you loading scores: 0.97 parts gene 1 and 0.24 parts gene 2. These scores tell you how much each original variable contributes to PC1.\n\n\nStep 4: Finding PC2\nPC2 is the line through the origin that is perpendicular (orthogonal) to PC1:\n\n\n\nPC2 is orthogonal to PC1 and captures the second-most variance.\n\n\nIf we scale this vector to length 1, we get loading scores of -0.24 parts gene 1 and 0.97 parts gene 2 - the eigenvector for PC2.\nTo draw the final PCA plot, rotate the graph so the projected points fall along the x and y axes (which are now PC1 and PC2). The intersection for each sample gives you the new coordinates to plot."

The number of PCs equals the number of samples or variables, whichever is lower.

    "text": "Practical Application: PCA for Genotypic Data in R\nNow let’s apply this to real genomic data. We’ll start with VCF files straight from the sequencer and walk through the entire workflow in R using SNPRelate.\n\nUnderstanding Your Input Data: VCF Files\nWhen you sequence samples and call variants, you typically get a VCF (Variant Call Format) file. This is a tab-delimited text file containing:\n\nMetadata lines (starting with ##) - information about reference genome, filters, sample names\nHeader line (starting with #CHROM) - column names\nVariant records - one line per variant with genotype data for all samples\n\nA simplified example:\n##fileformat=VCFv4.2\n##reference=grape_genome_v2.fa\n#CHROM  POS     ID      REF  ALT  QUAL  FILTER  INFO  FORMAT  Sample1  Sample2  Sample3\nchr1    1000    .       A    T    50    PASS    .     GT      0/0      0/1      1/1\nchr1    2000    .       G    C    55    PASS    .     GT      0/1      0/1      0/0\nThe GT (genotype) field shows alleles: 0/0 = homozygous reference, 0/1 = heterozygous, 1/1 = homozygous alternate.\n\n\nInstalling Required Packages\n# Install Bioconductor packages (if needed)\nif (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))\n    install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n\nBiocManager::install(\"SNPRelate\")\nBiocManager::install(\"gdsfmt\")\n\n# Load packages\nlibrary(SNPRelate)\nlibrary(gdsfmt)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\nConverting VCF to GDS Format\nSNPRelate works with GDS (Genomic Data Structure) files, which are optimized for large-scale genomic data. First, convert your VCF:\n# Convert VCF to GDS format\nvcf_file &lt;- \"your_samples.vcf.gz\"  # Works with compressed VCF\ngds_file &lt;- \"your_samples.gds\"\n\nsnpgdsVCF2GDS(vcf_file, gds_file, method = \"biallelic.only\")\n\n# Open the GDS file\ngenofile &lt;- snpgdsOpen(gds_file)\n\n# Check what's in the file\nsnpgdsSummary(genofile)\n\n\nQuality Control and Filtering\nBefore PCA, filter your data. SNPRelate provides functions for common QC steps:\n# Get sample and SNP IDs\nsample_ids &lt;- read.gdsn(index.gdsn(genofile, \"sample.id\"))\nsnp_ids &lt;- read.gdsn(index.gdsn(genofile, \"snp.id\"))\n\n# Filter for missing data (keep SNPs with &lt;10% missingness)\nsnp_missing &lt;- snpgdsSNPRateFreq(genofile)\nsnps_to_keep &lt;- snp_ids[snp_missing$MissingRate &lt; 0.1]\n\n# Filter for minor allele frequency (MAF &gt; 0.05)\nsnp_maf &lt;- snpgdsSNPRateFreq(genofile)\nsnps_to_keep &lt;- snps_to_keep[snp_maf$MinorFreq[snp_maf$MissingRate &lt; 0.1] &gt; 0.05]\n\n# Prune for linkage disequilibrium\n# This keeps relatively independent SNPs\nset.seed(1000)\nsnp_pruned &lt;- snpgdsLDpruning(genofile,\n                              ld.threshold = 0.2,\n                              snp.id = snps_to_keep,\n                              method = \"corr\")\n\n# Get the final list of pruned SNPs\nsnps_final &lt;- unlist(snp_pruned)\n\ncat(sprintf(\"Starting with %d SNPs\\n\", length(snp_ids)))\ncat(sprintf(\"After QC: %d SNPs\\n\", length(snps_to_keep)))\ncat(sprintf(\"After LD pruning: %d SNPs\\n\", length(snps_final)))\nWhy these filters? - Missing data: SNPs with high missingness are unreliable - MAF filtering: Rare variants contribute little information and increase noise - LD pruning: If SNPs are inherited together (linkage disequilibrium), they’re not independent. Including them inflates their contribution, and you capture LD structure rather than population structure\nMissing data handling: SNPRelate excludes missing genotypes by default. For advanced imputation (haplotype-based methods), use tools like Beagle or IMPUTE2 before converting to GDS. For most PCA applications, excluding missing data with the filters above is sufficient.\n\n\nComputing Principal Components\nNow run the PCA:\n# Compute PCA with filtered SNPs\npca &lt;- snpgdsPCA(genofile,\n                 snp.id = snps_final,\n                 autosome.only = FALSE,  # Set TRUE for human data\n                 num.thread = 4)\n\n# Check variance explained by each PC\npc_percent &lt;- pca$varprop * 100\ncat(sprintf(\"PC1 explains %.2f%% of variance\\n\", pc_percent[1]))\ncat(sprintf(\"PC2 explains %.2f%% of variance\\n\", pc_percent[2]))\ncat(sprintf(\"First 10 PCs explain %.2f%% of variance\\n\", sum(pc_percent[1:10])))\n\n# Close the GDS file\nsnpgdsClose(genofile)\nThe pca object contains: - pca$eigenvect - PC scores for each sample (coordinates for plotting) - pca$eigenval - eigenvalues (variance explained by each PC) - pca$varprop - proportion of total variance explained by each PC - pca$sample.id - sample IDs in the same order as eigenvectors\n\n\nVisualizing Results\nCreate a comprehensive visualization including scree plot and PCA plot:\n# Prepare data for plotting\npca_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  sample_id = pca$sample.id,\n  PC1 = pca$eigenvect[, 1],\n  PC2 = pca$eigenvect[, 2],\n  PC3 = pca$eigenvect[, 3]\n)\n\n# Add your metadata (population, treatment, etc.)\n# Assumes you have a metadata file with sample info\nmetadata &lt;- read.csv(\"sample_metadata.csv\")\npca_data &lt;- merge(pca_data, metadata, by = \"sample_id\")\n\n# Calculate percentage variance for axis labels\npc1_var &lt;- round(pca$varprop[1] * 100, 2)\npc2_var &lt;- round(pca$varprop[2] * 100, 2)\n\n# Create scree plot\nscree_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  PC = 1:length(pca$eigenval),\n  Variance = pca$varprop * 100\n)\n\nscree_plot &lt;- ggplot(scree_data[1:20, ], aes(x = PC, y = Variance)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"#323619\") +\n  geom_text(data = scree_data[1:10, ],\n            aes(label = sprintf(\"%.1f%%\", Variance), y = Variance + 0.5),\n            size = 3, color = \"gray40\") +\n  labs(title = \"Scree plot\",\n       x = \"Principal Component\",\n       y = \"Variance Explained (%)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\nprint(scree_plot)\n\n# Create PCA plot\npca_plot &lt;- ggplot(pca_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, \n                                  color = population,\n                                  shape = treatment)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dotted\", color = \"gray50\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = \"dotted\", color = \"gray50\") +\n  labs(title = \"PCA of Genotypic Data\",\n       x = paste0(\"PC1 (\", pc1_var, \"%)\"),\n       y = paste0(\"PC2 (\", pc2_var, \"%)\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\nprint(pca_plot)\n\n# Optional: 3D visualization\n# BiocManager::install(\"plotly\")\n# library(plotly)\n# plot_ly(pca_data, x = ~PC1, y = ~PC2, z = ~PC3,\n#         color = ~population, symbol = ~treatment,\n#         type = \"scatter3d\", mode = \"markers\")"

Complex non-linear relationships might be missed.\n2. Prioritizes global variance - Local structure between closely related samples may be obscured.\n3. Sensitive to preprocessing - LD pruning thresholds, MAF cutoffs, and missing data handling all affect results. Different choices give different patterns.\n4. Sampling bias matters - Elhaik (2022) showed that uneven sampling across populations can create artificial clustering. If you sample 100 individuals from population A and 10 from population B, PCA will reflect this imbalance, not necessarily true biological structure.\n5. The “cluster illusion” - PCA plots can suggest discrete groups even in continuously distributed data. Human pattern-seeking sees clusters that may not be biologically meaningful.\n6. LD structure vs. population structure - Improper LD pruning means you capture chromosomal LD patterns rather than genome-wide differentiation.\nBottom line: Use PCA as an exploratory tool. Validate patterns with complementary methods (ADMIXTURE, f-statistics, phylogenetics) before making strong biological claims."

Produces well-separated clusters that make cell type identification easier than PCA’s often-overlapping patterns.\nUMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection): Similar to t-SNE but faster and often better at preserving both local and global structure. Sometimes preferred in modern single-cell analysis.\nSelf-Organizing Maps (SOMs/Kohonen maps): Unsupervised neural networks creating 2D grid representations. Useful for pattern recognition without labels. Tutorial here.\nWhen to use what: - PCA: Most genomics applications - population structure, GWAS, expression analysis. Fast, interpretable, deterministic. - t-SNE/UMAP: Single-cell data, discrete cluster identification, exploratory analysis where local relationships matter more than global structure. - PCoA: Working with custom distance metrics or phylogenetic distances (analyzes pairwise dissimilarity matrices rather than raw data).\nFor population genetics and crop genomics, PCA remains the standard. Its interpretability (you can trace patterns back to specific SNPs), speed, and deterministic results make it the right tool for most jobs."
